  <h3>Zuppa Toscana Kitchen Experiment, Take One</h3>
</div>

    <p>I had been craving a hearty soup and decided to try my hand at making Zuppa Toscana. Although I don't fancy myself as much of a chef, I enjoy the process of cooking becasue it feels like laboratory experiment that I get to design, prapare, and execute. If the experiment outcome is favorable, my tastebuds get to enjoy my labors. If the experiment is a success and I get to share it, that is the ultimate positive outcome; joy and comfort and sustenance.</p>
    <p>I followed a recipe I found on <a href="http://allrecipes.com/" target="_blank">Allrecipes.com</a> which is a site I frequent for inspiration and guidance. I used this recipe <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/13126/zuppa-toscana/" target="_blank">"Zuppa Toscana"</a> and made the following modifications:</p>
    <ul class="mods">
      <li>3 pieces of bacon instead of 6</li>
      <li>1 and 1/2 quarts of water instead of 1</li>
      <li>1/3 cup of onion instead of 3/4 cup</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The smell of the soup simmering on the stove was wonderous and I liked the smokiness of the bacon alongside the kick of the spicy italian sausage. Although both flavors were complimented by the cream, the meats made the soup much too salty. As my mother suggested; next time I make this recipe I will try using a higher quality sausage with fewer perservatives to cut back on the salt content.
